# ⚡ War Lightning

**War Lightning** is a tank-based combat experience where survival is the only measure of success.

You are a newly deployed soldier, issued a tank and a single objective: **destroy the enemy**.

Victory earns prestige and reward. Remain undefeated, and your name will stand among warriors without end. Defeat leaves no record—except, perhaps, in the memory of the opponent next door.
